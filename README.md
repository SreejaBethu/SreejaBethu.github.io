**Project 1: Facial Recognition Using AI**
 This project aims to develop a facial recognition system using **artificial intelligence** **machine learning techniques** using **python**. The system is designed to identify and verify individuals based on their facial features, with potential security, law enforcement, and identity verification applications.           

**Features**

**Face Detection**: The system can detect faces in images and videos using OpenCV and Haar cascades.

**Face Recognition**: The system uses a machine learning model (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Support Vector Machines (SVMs)) to recognize and identify faces based on their unique features.

**Database Management**: The system stores and manages a database of known faces, allowing for efficient face recognition and verification.

**Real-time Processing**: The system can process and recognize faces in real time, making it suitable for applications that require rapid identification.

**Project 2: Paris Olympics Medal List**
This project visualizes the medal counts for countries participating in the Paris Olympics 2024 using Streamlit, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly.

**Features**

**Total Medals by Country:** Bar plot showcasing the total medals won by each country.

**Medal Distribution by Country:** Stacked bar plot of gold, silver, and bronze medals.

**Interactive Medal Visualization:** Dynamic Plotly chart for exploring medal distribution.

**Project 3: Real-time Weather Forecasting**
            This project leverages the OpenWeatherMap API and machine-learning techniques to forecast weather temperatures using **python**. The project uses historical weather data to train a **Random Forest Regressor model**, which predicts future temperatures. The forecasted **temperatures are converted to Fahrenheit** for ease of understanding. The project also provides **visualizations** to compare **actual vs predicted temperatures**, allowing for model evaluation and improvement. 
                
**Features**

**Weather Data Retrieval:** Retrieves historical weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

**Temperature Conversion:** Converts temperature data from Celsius to Fahrenheit for ease of understanding.

**Random Forest Regressor:** Trains a Random Forest Regressor model on historical weather data to predict future temperatures.

**Visualization:** Provides visualizations to compare actual vs predicted temperatures, allowing for model evaluation and improvement</p>
        
**Project 4: Realtime Stock Market Analysis Visualization**
  A simple financial analysis web application using Streamlit and Yahoo Finance. This app allows users to input a stock ticker and retrieve **real-time financial data, including stock information, price information, and business metrics**. The app uses the **Yahoo Finance API** to fetch and display the data in a user-friendly format.
